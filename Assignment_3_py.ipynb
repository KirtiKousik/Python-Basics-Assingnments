Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?"],"metadata":{"id":"pnjBl6Ea-jq4"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["- Ans: Functions reduce the need for duplicate code.

A return value can be any one of the four variable types: handle, integer, object, or string. The type of value your function returns depends largely on the task it performs.\n","    - Is it possible to have a return value in an expression Python?\n","A Python function will always have a return value. There is no notion of procedure or routine in Python.
