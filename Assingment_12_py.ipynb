At the highest level, a Document object represents the entire document. The Document object contains a list of Paragraph objects for the paragraphs in the document.

Each of these Paragraph objects contains a list of one or more Run objects.\n","\n","    The text in a Word document is more than just a string. It has font, size, color, and other styling information associated with it. A style in Word is a collection of these attributes. A Run object is a contiguous run of text with the same style.
